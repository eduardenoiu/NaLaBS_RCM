2. First change some settings. Choose Edit/Settings menu tab. In the Excel view you should choose the REQ ID and Text column in the requirement excel document.
3. To open a requirement excel file choose the File/Open menu tab
4. When opening a new excel document, please remove the Settings.xml in the Settings folder located in the same place as NALABS_RCM.exe. This needs to be done since the program might crash due to a bug.
